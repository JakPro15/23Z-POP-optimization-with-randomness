### Optimization algorithms in an environment of uncertainty

This project implements and compares two optimization algorithms:
- Evolution Strategy &mu;+&lambda;
- Differential Evolution DE/best/1/bin

on functions with random disturbances.

It was written as part of POP (Przeszukiwanie i Optymalizacja,
Searching and Optimization) class in semester 23Z (winter 2023).

The project is written in Python 3.11, using libraries specified in `requirements.txt`.

More detailed documentation, experiment results and conclusions are available in Polish in the file `pop-end-1.pdf`.
